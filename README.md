# Fancy Book Store

## Background
* Our client is a book lover but he never knows where to buy them as there are different retailers and each one sells the  books with a different price.
* Our client wants a web application that allows to choose the cheapest price or the one with a fastest delivery.
* We have an agreement with the retailers and each one provides a service to get the price and stock by ISBN.

## Requirements
* As a customer I want to buy a book at the best price
* As a customer I want to buy a book and get it as soon as possible
* As a customer I want to choose the retailer, just for personal reasons (just do it, I am paying for it)
* As a customer I want to see my choices on my shopping cart
* As a customer I want to receive an email with my shopping cart
